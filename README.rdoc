Dslify, born out of a need for improvement on Dslify

Add dsl accessors to any class.

Usage:
  class MyClass
    include Dslify
    
    dsl_methods :award, :people
  end
  
  mc = MyClass.new
  mc.award "Tony Award"
  mc.people ["Bob", "Frank", "Ben"]
  
You can set defaults as well:
  class MyClass
    default_options :award => "Tony Award"
  end

Finally, if your tree of available accessors runs higher and longer than
just 1 file, for instance, if you use Parenting, you can set forwarders to 
forward the query up the chain

class MyClass
  forwards_to :parent
end
